Retail Customer Clustering using Spectral, K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering with Streamlit dashboard.


Retail Customer Clustering – Machine Learning Project

This project analyses the Online Retail II dataset and clusters customers based on purchasing behaviour.
It compares Spectral Clustering, K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering, using:

Truncated SVD

L2 Normalisation

PCA & t-SNE visualisation

Silhouette, Davies–Bouldin, CH metrics

The project also includes a Streamlit dashboard for interactive clustering and data exploration.

Features

Customer–Product matrix creation

Dimensionality reduction

Three clustering algorithms

Interactive Streamlit UI

Cluster visualisations
